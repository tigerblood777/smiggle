# Smiggle Chatt

Smiggle Chat was created as a test project for an interview i did a while back it is a basic live chat that I created
This was before I had used web sockets etc so i am just using vue.js to fetch and send the data to the server
there was some time constraints on this project and in total it took me 4 hours to build.
To test it out register and login and start to message with someone. It is best experienced when 2 people login and message each other
